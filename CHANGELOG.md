# Changelog

What changed in each release, for the people who use Daylo. Earlier versions are not
listed: this file starts at 1.1.2, when the first change worth warning about arrived.

## 1.1.2

**The app file is now called Daylo.** It used to be called activity-tracker, the name
the project had before it was Daylo. Nothing else changes: your data stays where it
was, and installing this version over an older one cleans up the old file and fixes
your shortcuts. If you launch Daylo from a terminal on Linux, the command is now
`Daylo`.

**Backups you export are now called `daylo-backup-2026-09-09.json`** instead of
`activity-tracker-backup-...`. Backups you already have still open: Daylo reads what
is inside the file, not its name.

**A CSV export is no longer called a backup.** It is now saved as
`daylo-export-...csv`, and the export window says plainly that CSV is for Excel or
Google Sheets and cannot be loaded back into Daylo. Only the JSON backup can. Nothing
about the file changed, only its name and what we tell you about it, because calling
it a backup invited keeping one as your only copy.
